# 🔥 Fire Detection Drone using ESP32, ESP32-CAM, and Edge AI

This project is my final year undergraduate project — a **Fire Detection Drone** designed to perform real-time fire detection using **ESP32**, **ESP32-CAM**, **MPU6050**, and a **TinyML model** running on the edge.

## 🚀 Overview

The system combines embedded hardware and lightweight AI to identify fire outbreaks and stream live video over Wi-Fi — without cloud processing. The drone features basic flight capability and edge-based fire detection, offering a low-cost, scalable solution for wildfire monitoring, rural safety, and industrial surveillance.

## 🛠️ Components Used
- **ESP32** – Flight control and data processing  
- **ESP32-CAM** – Live video stream + image capture for fire detection  
- **MPU6050** – Gyroscope and accelerometer for motion sensing  
- **TinyML Model** – Deployed using TensorFlow Lite for Microcontrollers  
- **Battery, Frame, Motors** – For physical drone assembly

## 💡 Features
- On-device fire detection with TinyML (no internet needed)  
- Live video streaming via Wi-Fi  
- Basic flight control and motion sensing  
- Low power and lightweight design

## 📚 Skills Applied / Learned
- Embedded programming (Arduino, ESP-IDF)  
- Sensor interfacing (MPU6050)  
- Edge AI deployment with TinyML  
- Real-time system integration and testing

## 🚧 Project Status
- ✅ Fire detection working on ESP32-CAM  
- ✅ Basic drone flight achieved  
- 🔄 PID tuning and autonomous flight still in development
